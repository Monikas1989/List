# List
This is my fourth project for training purposes - YouCode. This page is in polish language. 
## About this project
"List" is page that allows you to create any list. You can enter there whatever you want and then mark done task or remove a completed/useless task.
There are also additional buttons: "Ukryj ukończone" ("Hide completed") and "Ukończ wszystkie" ("complete all"). The button responsible for "complete all"
changes its background when it is useless. Both buttons they are invisible if you do not enter anything in the list. The button "Hide completed" changes his name when clicked for "Pokaż ukończone" ("show finished"). 


Most of my code is using JS. 

Visit my demo and have a good time. I greet you.
